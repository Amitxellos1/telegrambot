# Security Guidelines

## Password Requirements

All passwords must meet the following criteria:
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- Cannot be any of your last 10 passwords
- Must be changed every 90 days

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication is mandatory for:
- Email access
- VPN connections
- Cloud storage
- Financial systems
- Admin portals

Use the company-approved authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator). SMS-based 2FA is not permitted for security reasons.

## Data Classification

### Confidential
- Customer personal data
- Financial records
- Employee information
- Trade secrets

### Internal
- Project documentation
- Internal communications
- Meeting notes
- Training materials

### Public
- Marketing materials

## Phishing Prevention

- Never click links in suspicious emails
- Verify sender addresses carefully
- Report phishing attempts to security@company.com
- When in doubt, contact IT before taking action
- The company will never ask for passwords via email

## Device Security

- Enable full disk encryption on all devices
- Use only company-approved USB devices
- Lock your computer when leaving your desk (Win+L or Cmd+Ctrl+Q)
- Report lost or stolen devices immediately
- Do not connect personal devices to the corporate network

## Incident Reporting

If you suspect a security breach:
1. Do not attempt to fix it yourself
2. Disconnect the affected device from the network
3. Contact security@company.com immediately
4. Document what you observed
5. Preserve any evidence

Security incidents are taken seriously. Prompt reporting is essential and will not result in punishment for honest mistakes.
